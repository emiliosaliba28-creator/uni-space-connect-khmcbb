The function would look like this:\r\nTHere would be an admin login and a user login. Here is an example of a typical usage. The admin would login, create a new space, give it a name and number, take photos of the space, add information of who manages the space, who are the academic supervisors, what are the access requirements, attach relevant documentation, add relevant links, and emergency procedures. The app will then generate a QR code that can be printed and displayed at the door of the space for other users to scan using the QR code and access the relevant information. The admin needs to be able to delete and create spaces. All users need to use the single sign on function assigned by the uni to sign in, and then depending on the role they have been assigned they will be signed in as admin or users. When a space is deleted, admin should be able to reactivate a space from a recycle bin. Users would sign in, scan the QR code on the door using the app, and then access the profile of that space with all the relevant information that an admin would have entered. THey can access the links and documents that are in there as well. Start with that and we can make adjustments as needed."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
