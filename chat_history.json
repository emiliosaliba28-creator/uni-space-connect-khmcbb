The function would look like this:\r\nTHere would be an admin login and a user login. Here is an example of a typical usage. The admin would login, create a new space, give it a name and number, take photos of the space, add information of who manages the space, who are the academic supervisors, what are the access requirements, attach relevant documentation, add relevant links, and emergency procedures. The app will then generate a QR code that can be printed and displayed at the door of the space for other users to scan using the QR code and access the relevant information. The admin needs to be able to delete and create spaces. All users need to use the single sign on function assigned by the uni to sign in, and then depending on the role they have been assigned they will be signed in as admin or users. When a space is deleted, admin should be able to reactivate a space from a recycle bin. Users would sign in, scan the QR code on the door using the app, and then access the profile of that space with all the relevant information that an admin would have entered. THey can access the links and documents that are in there as well.

This route now:\n\n- Loads the existing space data for editing\n- Pre-fills all form fields with current values\n- Allows editing of all space properties (name, number, photos, manager info, supervisor info, etc.)\n- Validates required fields before saving\n- Updates the space using the `dataStore.updateSpace()` method\n- Shows success/error messages and navigates back when done\n\n### 2. **Fixed Delete Button Not Working**\n\n**Problem**: The delete functionality wasn't working properly.\n\n**Solution**: Enhanced the delete functionality in `app/admin/index.tsx`:\n\n- Added better error handling with try-catch blocks\n- Improved user feedback with confirmation dialogs that show the space name\n- Added success messages after deletion\n- Enhanced console logging for debugging\n- Fixed the space loading after deletion to properly refresh the UI\n\n### 3. **Enhanced Data Store**\n\n**Problem**: The data store needed improvements for better space management.\n\n**Solution**: Updated `data/store.ts` with:\n\n- Better error handling and logging in all methods\n- Enhanced `getSpaceById()` to find spaces in both active and deleted collections\n- Improved `updateSpace()` method to handle both active and deleted spaces\n- Added a `permanentlyDeleteSpace()` method for future use\n- Better console logging throughout for debugging\n\n### 4. **Additional Improvements**\n\n- **Better UI feedback**: Added loading states, success messages, and better error handling\n- **Enhanced recycle bin**: Shows deletion dates and better restore functionality\n- **Improved navigation**: All navigation now includes proper console logging for debugging\n- **Form validation**: Comprehensive validation in the edit form with user-friendly error messages\n\n## Key Features Now Working:\n\n\u2705 **Edit Button**: Now navigates to a fully functional edit screen\n\u2705 **Delete Button**: Properly deletes spaces and moves them to recycle bin\n\u2705 **Restore Function**: Can restore deleted spaces from the recycle bin\n\u2705 **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all required fields\n\u2705 **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages and loading states\n\u2705 **Debug Logging**: Extensive console logging for troubleshooting\n\nThe app should now work smoothly with both edit and delete functionality fully operational!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-30T07:05:16Z"}]
